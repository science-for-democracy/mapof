# Mapel-core
This package contains the necessary core parts of the mapel ecosystem. Mapel can
be used to draw maps of different kinds of computational problem instances based
on metrices defining distances between two instances.

This package provides the framework that can be further extended. Some of the
extensions, regarding problems for Computational Social Choice, are already
available on PyPi:
1. [mapel-elections](https://pypi.org/project/mapel-elections/)
1. [mapel-roommates](https://pypi.org/project/mapel-rommmates/)
1. [mapel-marriages](https://pypi.org/project/mapel-marriages/)


For the most recent version of mapel, visit its [git
repo](https://github.com/szufix/mapel).

# Installation
